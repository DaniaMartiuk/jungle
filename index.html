        <img src="images/jungle4.JPG" class="content_img">
        <p>A jungle is land covered with dense vegetation dominated by trees. Application of the term has varied greatly during the last several centuries. Prior to the 1970s, tropical rainforests were generally referred to as jungles but this terminology has fallen out of usage. Jungles in Western literature can represent a less civilised or unruly space outside the control of civilisation: attributed to the jungle's association in colonial discourse with places colonised by Europeans.</p>
        <h4>Etymology</h4>
        <p>The word jungle originates from the Sanskrit word Jangla (Sanskrit: जङ्गल), meaning uncultivated land . Although the Sanskrit word refers to dry land, it has been suggested that an Anglo-Indian interpretation led to its connotation as a dense "tangled thicket" while others have argued that a cognate word in Urdu did refer to forests. The term is prevalent in many languages of the Indian subcontinent, and the Iranian Plateau, where it is commonly used to refer to the plant growth replacing primeval forest or to the unkempt tropical vegetation that takes over abandoned areas.</p>
        <h4>Wildlife</h4>
        <p>Because jungles occur on all inhabited landmasses and may incorporate numerous vegetation and land types in different climatic zones, the wildlife of jungles can not be defined.</p>
        <h4>As dense and impenetrable vegetation</h4>
        <p>One of the most common meanings of jungle is land overgrown with tangled vegetation at ground level, especially in the tropics. Typically such vegetation is sufficiently dense to hinder movement by humans, requiring that travellers cut their way through. This definition draws a distinction between rainforest and jungle, since the understorey of rainforests is typically open of vegetation due to a lack of sunlight, and hence relatively easy to traverse. Jungles may exist within, or at the borders of, rainforests in areas where rainforest has been opened through natural disturbance such as hurricanes, or through human activity such as logging. The successional vegetation that springs up following such disturbance of rainforest is dense and impenetrable and is a ‘typical’ jungle. Jungle also typically forms along rainforest margins such as stream banks, once again due to the greater available light at ground level.</p>
        <p>Monsoon forests and mangroves are commonly referred to as jungles of this type. Having a more open canopy than rainforests, monsoon forests typically have dense understoreys with numerous lianas and shrubs making movement difficult, while the prop roots and low canopies of mangroves produce similar difficulties.</p>

        <h4>Temperature</h4>
        <p>The temperature in the jungle is generally very warm daytime weather with cool nights.  On average, day temperatures will range from around 21-25 degrees C with the temperature reaching up too mid 30 degree some days.  During the night, the temperature drops down between 10-20 degrees causing the morning to be cool and misty.</p>
        <h4>Location and Rainfall</h4>
        <p>Jungles grow along the edges of the rainforests.  The Amazon Jungle lies right on the equator so it receives a lot of sunlight making the climate very warm and humid.  It also receives a lot of rainfall making the combination of sunlight and water, very beneficial for the vegetation growth in the jungle.  During the day, the temperature can get up to 33°C around mid-afternoon, and at night it cools down to around 18°C.  The cooler temperatures during the night creates a morning mist in the jungle, which throughout the day, transform into rain storm clouds that open up and give the jungle its wet weather.  The mountainous region in the jungle receives the most rainfall.  For more information visit thinkjungle.com for more jungle climate information.
        <p>Some of the best known jungles in the world are:<br><br>
        1. The Amazon Jungle<br>
        2.The Congo Jungle<br>
        3. Corcavado Jungle<br>
        4. Â Nainital
        </p>
        <h4>Water Cycle</h4>
        <p>The water cycle has a huge impact on the jungle because there are so many plants that rely on water to survive.  The rain clouds are caused from such humid temperatures that cause the water to evaporate and condense into rain clouds.   When the rain falls, it hydrates the plants and gives the rivers fresh water for animals to use.</p>
        <h4>Soil</h4>
        <p>Even though the jungle has a very dense level of vegetation, the soil quality is very quite weak.  The high amounts of bacterial decay, prevents humus from growing in the soil.  The soil in the jungle does not contain a high amount of nutrients.  This causes plants roots to form near the ground's surface because of the lack of nutrients down below.  The nutrients found near the top of the soil are from decaying dead plants and animals.</p>
